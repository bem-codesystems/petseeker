# Petseeker Open Source Project

Project created to help on the rescue, finding and maintaning the animals that live abandoned, even on streets, florests, and all kinds of environment possible.

## Purpose

- Help to find lost animals.
- Help these animals to get a family that REALLY wants them.
- Help to find good people, willing to afford, or contribute on crowdfundings to give these animals a decent life.

## Methodologies

- As programmers, we aim to help using technology and software development as a way to achieve this end goal. This is a project based in human and animal rights to freedom, the right to have a life, a home and a family that doesn't explore neither uses violence on them.
- We will construct a platform that will do this matching between people and the needed animals.

## Project Scope

1 - High level description.

Build a PWA that:
- Read GeoData from Open Source APIs.
- Integrates with iOT(Drone CAMs) and interacts with its data in Realtime.
- Makes use of IA and ML to locate animals on closed forests or places of difficult acessibility.
- Has a built-in mechanism of crowdfunding and full possibility of p2p(peer-to-peer) money transfer to enable the animals saving and cover emergency costs in case of a hurt animal being found.

## Manifest

1 - Start Small to Become Big

2 - Save the animals, not our pocket

3 - Stay anonymous. Let the cause make some noise.

4 - Make increasing help. Don't try to hug the world in one step only.

5 - Animals are our friends. Sometimes the man looks more animal when compared to them.

6 - We are stack agnostic. Let's move over the flow, and use what fits best to the job.
