# Petseeker Open Source Project

Project created to help on the rescue, finding and maintaning the animals that live abandoned, even on streets, florests, and all kinds of environment possible.

## Purpose

- Help to find lost animals.
- Help these animals to get a family that REALLY wants them.
- Help to find good people, willing to afford, or contribute on crowdfundings to give these animals a decent life.

## Methodologies

- As programmers, we aim to help using technology and software development as a way to achieve this end goal. This is a project based in human and animal rights to freedom, the right to have a life, a home and a family that doesn't explore neither uses violence on them.
- We will construct a platform that will do this matching between people and the needed animals.
